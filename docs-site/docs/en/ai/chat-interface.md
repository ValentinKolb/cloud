# Chat interface

Compose Cloud chat from two layers:

- `@k2b/ui` owns the generic timeline, message shell, composer, attachments,
  model selection, commands, context usage, loading, and accessibility.
- `@valentinkolb/cloud/ai` owns the controller, session protocol, persistence,
  tools, approvals, files, retry, fork, and steering policy.

Cloud adapters project protocol state and payloads across that boundary. There
is no second Cloud-specific chat component set.

## Compose a Cloud chat

```tsx
import type { AiPublicModelProfile } from "@valentinkolb/cloud/ai";
import { createAiChatController } from "@valentinkolb/cloud/ai/solid";
import {
  AiChatActionsProvider,
  aiChatModelOptions,
  aiComposerSendInput,
  createAiChatTimeline,
} from "@valentinkolb/cloud/ai/ui";
import { Chat } from "@k2b/ui";
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

export function ItemChat(props: {
  itemId: string;
  models: AiPublicModelProfile[];
  selectedModelId: () => string;
  selectModel: (id: string) => void;
}) {
  const chat = createAiChatController({
    baseUrl: `/api/inventory/ai/items/${props.itemId}`,
    trackViewedState: true,
  });
  const [draft, setDraft] = createSignal("");

  const Conversation = () => {
    const items = createAiChatTimeline({
      messages: chat.messages,
      activeTurn: chat.activeTurn,
    });

    return (
      <Chat>
        <Chat.Timeline
          items={items()}
          loading={chat.loadingConversation()}
          hasMore={chat.hasMoreHistory()}
          loadingOlder={chat.loadingOlder()}
          onLoadOlder={chat.loadOlderMessages}
        />
        <Chat.Composer
          value={draft()}
          onValueChange={setDraft}
          models={aiChatModelOptions(props.models)}
          selectedModelId={props.selectedModelId()}
          onModelChange={props.selectModel}
          state={chat.runStatus() === "stopping" ? "stopping" : chat.running() ? "running" : "idle"}
          onSubmit={(input) => {
            const payload = aiComposerSendInput(input);
            return input.intent === "steer"
              ? chat.steer(payload.message ?? "")
              : chat.send({ ...payload, modelProfileId: props.selectedModelId() });
          }}
          onStop={chat.abort}
        />
      </Chat>
    );
  };

  return (
    <div class="k2b-ui">
      <AiChatActionsProvider
        actions={{
          onApproval: async (request, input) => {
            await chat.respondToApproval(request, input);
          },
          onFrontendToolResult: async (request, result) => {
            await chat.submitFrontendToolResult(request, result);
          },
          fileUrl: chat.fileContentUrl,
        }}
      >
        <Conversation />
      </AiChatActionsProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Keep the `k2b-ui` scope on the nearest stable application root and import
`@k2b/ui/styles.css` once in the application stylesheet.

The controller exposes:

- conversations and active conversation state;
- messages, active turn, and stream status;
- history and timeline loading;
- send, steer, abort, retry, fork, and compaction;
- approval and frontend-tool actions;
- file URLs and file counts;
- one error state for the active chat.

## Attach Cloud resources

Treat a Cloud resource like another composer attachment: keep its structured
`ref`, plus optional `title`, `icon`, and root-relative `href` presentation
metadata. `aiComposerSendInput()` preserves that data for the conversation
draft, and sent messages render it as an attachment chip. A supplied `href`
links the chip back to the owning application.

The attachment does not copy resource contents into the draft and does not
grant access. The model receives only the resource reference and presentation
metadata, and must read the resource through the owning application's
authorized capability. Attachment metadata and resource data returned by that
capability remain untrusted context. Editing or retrying a user message
preserves the resource attachment while copy actions expose only the visible
user text.

`Chat.Composer` submits a draft entered during an active response as `steer` by
default. Set `runningSubmitIntent="queue"` when the application owns a local or
durable follow-up queue, then handle the `queue` intent in `onSubmit`. The
shared composer only reports intent; queue ordering, persistence, delivery,
editing, and deletion remain application policy.

## Show meaningful states

Distinguish:

- connecting from generating;
- waiting for approval from running;
- stopping from stopped;
- failed from aborted;
- an empty conversation from a loading conversation.

Keep the Stop action available until the server accepts the abort.

Render tool input and output as data. Do not inject model text as HTML.

Capability calls use the owning application's saved name, icon, and optional
accent in running, approval, success, and failure states. The saved snapshot
keeps history readable when an app is temporarily unavailable or later changes
its registry metadata; ordinary Nessi tools keep the generic tool presentation.

Generic tool rows and disclosures use `Chat.Activity` from `@k2b/ui`. Cloud
only supplies protocol-derived labels and specialized bodies such as web search
results, first-party favicons, structured data, and approval controls. Keep
those domain renderers in Cloud instead of duplicating the shared activity
shell.

An active response always uses the shared streaming state of `Chat.Message`,
including before the first model block arrives. It renders the minimal
three-dot progress indicator; do not add a separate generating activity or
label. Active tool rows set `busy` on `Chat.Activity`, which uses a quiet accent
sweep across the tool icon and title instead of adding another loader.

Approval prompts span the available message column and lead with the owning
application's name and icon. The primary control names the concrete action;
review labels are emphasized and explanatory copy appears only when it adds
information beyond that action name. Expanding Details renders validated
arguments in a separate full-width structured-data panel below the prompt.

## Handle frontend tools

Pass approval, frontend-tool, retry, fork, and file handlers through
`AiChatActionsProvider`. Rich Cloud blocks remain Cloud-owned JSX inside the
generic timeline.

The controller claims each call once, runs the handler, and sends the result
back to the turn. Show interaction tools only when the relevant application
view is present.

Server tools remain the default for domain access.

runtime monitoring and production checks.
