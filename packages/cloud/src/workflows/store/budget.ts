/**
 * Effect budgets.
 *
 * A dry run and a preflight are the same operation: execute the plan with
 * impure steps reporting what they *would* do instead of doing it. Preflight is
 * that, with the reported effects counted against a cap.
 *
 * Grids had no cap at all — a workflow with an email action inside a loop over
 * ten thousand records was bounded only by `maxLoopItems`, which limits
 * iterations, not messages. Mail had budgets but checked them once, before
 * execution, so a run could be approved for one set of effects and go on to
 * perform a different one.
 *
 * Hence the rule here: the budget is charged at the moment of the effect, not
 * only ahead of it. That makes the preflight/execution divergence harmless
 * rather than something a hash has to detect — whatever the plan turns out to
 * do, it still cannot exceed what was approved.
