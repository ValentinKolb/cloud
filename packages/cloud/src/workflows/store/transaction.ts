/**
 * Composing kernel writes into an app's own transaction.
 *
 * Every store function takes an optional `db`, and the whole point of that
 * option is that an app can run a kernel write inside a transaction it already
 * owns — creating a workflow and its app-side profile together, say, so a crash
 * cannot leave one without the other.
 *
 * Bun rejects `begin` inside a transaction; a nested unit is a savepoint. A
 * handle only has `savepoint` when it *is* a transaction, which is what makes
 * this reliable rather than a convention callers have to remember.
