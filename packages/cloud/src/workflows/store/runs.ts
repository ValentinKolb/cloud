/**
 * The kernel's run store.
 *
 * Grids and Mail each wrote their own version of this — 904 and 717 lines that
 * agreed on almost everything and differed in the places that matter: Mail
 * leased a target while Grids leased a run, Mail fenced with a generation *and*
 * a token while Grids used the generation alone, and Mail's `heartbeat`
 * silently ignored the run it was passed.
 *
 * Execution is "find the first step with no recorded outcome, run it, record
 * it". Crash recovery is that same loop, which is why there is no separate
 * recovery path below: a claim on a run whose lease expired resumes it, and
 * the journal makes the steps that already happened free to skip.
 *
 * The fence is `execution_generation`. Every claim increments it, so a worker
 * that lost its lease writes with a stale generation and every one of its
 * updates matches zero rows. Nothing here trusts wall-clock ordering.
