/**
 * Resolve the encryption key passed to stdlib's `crypto.symmetric.encrypt`.
 *
 * Stdlib derives keys via HKDF and requires the input to be a hex string
 * (it calls `fromHex(key)` internally). Two cases:
 *
 *  1. APP_SECRET is already a valid hex string (any even length).
 *     Pass it through unchanged. THIS IS THE PRODUCTION PATH — existing
 *     deployments use hex secrets and have data encrypted with the secret
 *     verbatim. Any transformation here would change the derived HKDF key
 *     and make every previously encrypted settings row unreadable.
 *
 *  2. APP_SECRET is not valid hex (e.g. a passphrase like "supersecret").
 *     Deterministically derive a 32-byte hex key via SHA-256. Same input
 *     always produces the same hex output, so settings encrypted with a
 *     non-hex secret stay decryptable across restarts.
 *
 * ⚠️  DO NOT change the hex-passthrough branch. Hashing a hex secret would
 * silently break every prod instance: encrypted settings could no longer
 * be decrypted because the HKDF input would differ from what was used at
 * write time. The branch exists specifically to preserve backward compat
 * with deployments that have always used hex-format APP_SECRET.
